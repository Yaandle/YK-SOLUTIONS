# Computer Vision Guide

## 🔑 Overview
Introduction to computer vision, models, and practical robotics applications.  
*(Starting point for vision pipeline and robotics integration.)*

---

## 📚 Core Concepts
- Detection (identify objects in images)
- Segmentation (outline objects with masks)
- Keypoints / Pose (find and track parts of an object)

---

## 🛠️ Methods / Tools
- YOLO models → detection, segmentation, keypoints
- Depth cameras (e.g., RealSense) → 3D mapping
- ROS → robotics system integration

---

## 🎯 Practical Example
- Step 1: Capture RGB + depth image  
- Step 2: Run YOLOv11 detection  
- Step 3: Publish results into ROS pipeline
